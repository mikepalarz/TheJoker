# The Joker
This is an app that was developed as a part of the [Udacity Android Development
Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) 
program. It supplies jokes taken from [ICNDB](http://www.icndb.com/) and displays them 
to the end user. It includes features such as:

- Providing jokes to end users through the combination of a Google Cloud Endpoints
(GCE) server and a custom Java library.
- Offering both free and paid flavors of the app, which inherently also created 
multiple build variants of the application.
- Displaying both banner and interstitial ads within the free flavor.
